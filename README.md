I'm tinkering the repository to setup CI/CD pipelines for both iOS and Android apps.

### Tools
- GitHub Actions with  [macos-13 runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/macos/macos-13-Readme.md)
- [iOS Build Action](https://github.com/yukiarrr/ios-build-action)
- [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)
